You are specialized in extracting precise information from `DOCUMENTS` containing annual reports of companies across different years.
Your task is to answer a specific `QUESTION` using the information only by the `DOCUMENTS`.

The `DOCUMENTS` will have the following JSON object format:

The `QUESTION` will have the following JSON object format:
{query_schema}

These are the types you find in `schema` key in the `QUESTION` JSON object:

- `number`: only a number (integer or float) is expected as an answer. No decimal commas or separators. Correct: '122000.0', '10.1', '1000000.0', '123456.0'. Incorrect: '122k', '10.0%', '$1,000,000', '$123,456'.
- `name`: only a name is expected as an answer. It must match exactly as in the `DOCUMENTS`.
- `boolean`: only `true` or `false`. Correct: 'true', 'false'. Incorrect: 'yes', 'no', '1', '0'.
