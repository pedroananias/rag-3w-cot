In addition, the Group\u2019s financial performance has been impacted by COVID-19 as well as severe wet weather conditions as a result of La Ni\u00f1a.\n\nThe main features of the result for the 12 months ended 30 June 2022 were:\n\n\u00a7 Total revenue1 of $12.0 billion, down 2.0%\n\n\u00a7 Statutory EBITA of $358.0 million, down 10.7%; from $401.0 million\n\n\u00a7 EBITA margin of 3.0% down from 3.3% at 30 June 2021\n\n\u00a7 Statutory earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) of $323.2 million, down 3.5%; from $334.8 million\n\n\u00a7 Statutory net profit after tax and before amortisation of acquired intangible assets (NPATA) of $176.4 million, down 23.3%; from $230.0 million\n\n\u00a7 Statutory net profit after tax (NPAT) of $152.0 million, down 17.3%; from $183.7 million.\n\n11\n\nGearing has decreased by 1.3 percentage points (pp) to 17.7% since June 2021 reflecting the strong operating cash flows and proceeds from the divestment program partially offset by the impact of the share buy-back program.\n\nCash conversion for the year was 83.9% and 88.9% after adjusting for $22.3 million2 cash outflows related to items recognised in FY20 and funded from the July 2020 capital raising, and $12.7 million bid costs for the Queensland Train Manufacturing Program."

This work built on Downer\u2019s previous TCFD analysis in 2019, and reaffirmed that climate change presents considerable opportunities for Downer \u2013 and that these opportunities will increase as efforts to decarbonise accelerate.\n\nThe analysis determined that Downer\u2019s greatest exposure to transition risk are its asphalt plants as well as its light and heavy vehicle fleet and plant and equipment. Downer has decarbonisation strategies and plans to minimise exposure to transition risks.\n\nIn addition, Downer has undertaken a review of its capital allocation process to integrate climate thinking and considerations. This led to the creation of a centralised decarbonisation fund to support initiatives that will help achieve Downer\u2019s net zero commitments."

The impact of widespread COVID-19 infections within the community and the restrictions placed on businesses and employees by government were not anticipated at the time we set our targets and forecasts for 2022. Additionally, the prolonged and severe wet weather patterns experienced throughout Australia\u2019s eastern States have been debilitating and unprecedented. The impact of COVID-19 and severe wet weather patterns have materially impacted the Company\u2019s financial performance in 2022.\n\nNotwithstanding the difficulties presented during the period our staff and management responded outstandingly in highly challenging circumstances, maximising outcomes for shareholders, protecting not only the performance of your Company but also the communities in which Downer operates, all while delivering quality service outcomes for our customers. If not for this \u2018above and beyond\u2019 effort, our Company would not be in the strong position it is in today.\n\nWe remain leaders in the markets in which we operate, strengthening our position over the past 12 months with $36.1 billion work in hand. Our Net Debt to EBITDA is just 1.6x with available liquidity of $1.9 billion. We have won over $3.5 billion in new work over the last quarter of 2022 setting the Company up for a strong 2023 and beyond.\n\nDuring the period our executive team have continued to improve the portfolio by:"

Downer\u2019s Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate for the year was 0.82 and the Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate was 2.35. Sadly, a long-term Downer employee in New Zealand died in May 2022 following a fall at work. Although the cause of death is not yet known, Downer has treated this as a workplace fatality. Downer operates in sectors that are exposed to high-risk activities and, while we have a history of strong safety performance, we are determined to learn from this loss. The health and safety of our people is Downer\u2019s number one priority.\n\nThe impact of divestments or acquisitions on executive remuneration can be significant. The Board\u2019s overarching concern is to ensure executives:\n\n\u00a7 Are accountable for delivery of the annual budget and business plan\n\n\u00a7 Consider potential acquisition or divestment opportunities without the influence of their impact on remuneration outcomes."

Guerdon Associates Pty Ltd does not provide services to management and is considered to be independent.\n\n6. Description of Executive Remuneration\n\n6.1 Executive remuneration structure\n\nExecutive remuneration has a fixed component and a component that varies with performance.\n\nThe variable component ensures that a proportion of pay varies with performance. Performance is assessed annually for performance periods covering one year and three years. Payment for performance assessed over one year is an STI. Payment for performance over a three-year period is an LTI.\n\nIn order for maximum STIs to be awarded, performance must achieve a stretch goal that is a clear margin above the planned budget for the period. This enables the Company to attract and retain better performing executives, and ensures pay outcomes are aligned with shareholder returns.\n\nTarget STIs are less than the maximum STI. Target STI is payable on achievement of planned objectives. For executives, the target STI is 75% of the maximum STI. The maximum total remuneration that can be earned by an executive is capped. The maximums are determined as a percentage of fixed remuneration."

While market levels of remuneration are monitored on a regular basis, there is no contractual requirement or expectation that any adjustments will be made.\n\nNo adjustment has been made to remuneration for the Managing Director since July 2012, other than a voluntary reduction in his fixed remuneration by 50% for the period 1 April 2020 to 30 June 2020 in recognition of the likely impact of the coronavirus pandemic on Downer and its people. The funds from this voluntary remuneration reduction, along with contributions from Directors and other executives, were used to establish a fund to provide financial assistance to employees experiencing severe hardship.\n\n6.3 Short-term Incentive\n\n6.3.1 STI tabular summary\n\nThe following table outlines the major features of the 2022 STI plan."

This has been applied to performance measured over the Company\u2019s financial year to 30 June 2022.\n\nThe basis of the plan is designed to align STI outcomes with financial results. No STI is paid unless a minimum profit gateway is met. For corporate executives, the gateway is based on the Group budgeted profit target. For Divisional executives, the gateway is based on the Division budgeted profit target. Profit for this purpose is defined as NPATA for Corporate executives and EBITA for Divisional executives. This minimum must be at a challenging level to justify the payment of STI to an executive and deliver an acceptable return for the funds employed in running the business. Positive and negative impacts from material but unbudgeted and opportunistic transactions are excluded from gateway assessment. Whether to exclude the impact of significant items (positive or negative) is considered on a case by case basis.\n\nAs noted in section 6.1, the maximum STI that can be earned is capped to minimise excessive risk taking.\n\nDeferral is a key feature as part of the STI structure. Payment of 50% of the award is made at the time of award in cash and the remaining 50% of the award earned is deferred over two years."

This is an equity-based plan that provides for a reward that varies with Company performance over three-year measures of performance.\n\nThree-year measures of performance are considered to be the maximum reasonable time period for setting incentive targets for earnings per share and are generally consistent with market practice in the Company\u2019s sector.\n\nThe payment is in the form of performance rights. The performance rights do not have any dividend entitlements or voting rights. If all the vesting requirements are satisfied, the performance rights will vest and the executives will receive shares in the Company or cash at the discretion of the Board.\n\nThe 2022 LTI represents an entitlement to performance rights to ordinary shares exercisable subject to satisfaction of both a performance condition and a continued employment condition. Grants will be in three equal tranches, with each tranche subject to an independent performance requirement. The performance requirements for each tranche will share two common features:\n\n\u00a7 Once minimum performance conditions are met, the proportion of performance rights that qualify for vesting commences at 30% and gradually increases pro-rata with performance. This approach provides a strong motivation for meeting minimum performance, but avoids a large \u2018cliff\u2019 which may encourage excessive risk taking"

TSR is calculated as the difference in share price over the performance period, plus the value of shares earned from reinvesting dividends received over this period, expressed as a percentage of the share price at the beginning of the performance period. If the TSR for each company in the comparator group is ranked from highest to lowest, the median TSR is the percentage return to shareholders that exceeds the TSR for half of the comparison companies. The 75th percentile TSR is the percentage return required to exceed the TSR for 75% of the comparison companies.\n\nPerformance rights in the tranche to which the relative TSR performance requirement applies will vest pro-rata between the median and 75th percentile. That is, 30% of the tranche vest at the 50th percentile, 32.8% at the 51st percentile, 35.6% at the 52nd percentile and so on until 100% vest at the 75th percentile."

The EPS measure is based on AASB 133 Earnings per Share.\n\nThe tranche of performance rights dependent on the EPS performance condition will vest pro-rata between 5% compound annual EPS growth and 10% compound annual EPS growth.\n\nVesting applies on a pro-rata basis from 30% upon meeting the minimum compound annual EPS growth performance level of 5% to 100% at 10% compound annual EPS growth.

That is, executives should be \u2018no better or worse off\u2019 as a result of the transaction. No adjustments are made for market reactions to a transaction as the Board believes that management is accountable for those outcomes.\n\nThe Board considers this approach to be appropriate as it:\n\n\u00a7 Ensures that executives and the Board consider these transactions solely based on the best interests of Downer\n\n\u00a7 Means executives remain accountable for transaction execution and post-transaction performance from the next budget cycle\n\n\u00a7 Ensures that executives complete opportunistic transactions that are in the long-term interests of shareholders\n\n\u00a7 Is consistent with the Board\u2019s long-term view when considering the value of major transactions to Downer\u2019s shareholders"

Relief from certain regulatory requirements was applied for and has been received from the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. During the year, the LTI plan for the 2022 financial year was approved as outlined in section 6.4 of this report, however grants of performance rights have not yet been made to KMP, however they are expected to be made early in the 2023 financial year. This means that grants in relation to 2022 and 2023 are expected to be made during the 2023 financial year.\n\nConsistent with the ASX Listing Rules for the adjustment of the quantity of rights and options on issue at the time of new share issues, the quantity of unlapsed rights granted to executives under the 2019 plan was adjusted by the ASX Adjustment Factor of 0.9812 in respect of the bonus element of the accelerated non-renounceable entitlement offer made during the 2021 year.\n\nThe following table shows the number of performance rights granted by Downer EDI Limited and percentage of performance rights that vested or were forfeited during the year for each grant that affects compensation in this or future reporting periods.\n\n2019 Plan"

The Board believes this is necessary for Non-executive Directors to maintain their independence.\n\nNon-executive Directors are not entitled to retirement benefits. Shareholders approved an annual aggregate cap of $2.0 million for Non-executive Director fees at the 2008 AGM. The allocation of fees to Non-executive Directors within this cap has been determined after consideration of a number of factors, including the time commitment of Directors, the size and scale of the Company\u2019s operations, the skill sets of Board members, the quantum of fees paid to Non-executive Directors of comparable companies and participation in Board Committee work.\n\nThe Chairman receives a fee of $410,625 per annum (inclusive of all Committee fees) and superannuation. The other Non-executive Directors each receive a base fee of $164,250 per annum. Additional fees are paid for Committee duties: $35,000 for the chair of the Audit and Risk Committee; $27,000 for the chair of each of the Zero Harm Committee and Remuneration Committee, and $17,000 for the chair of the Tender Risk Evaluation Committee."

In addition, an assessment is made on the extent of flexibility provided by the fee pool to recruit any additional Directors for planned succession after allocation of fees to existing Directors.\n\nA review of fees was conducted in 2021. The review found that base fees paid to the Chairman and Non-executive Directors remained appropriate however fees paid for chairing or serving as a member of a committee were below market levels. Accordingly, as foreshadowed in the 2021 Remuneration Report, the following changes in fees were applied from 1 July 2021:\n\n\u00a7 Fees set at a fixed value inclusive of superannuation, rather than a fee plus superannuation at the superannuation guarantee rate\n\n\u00a7 Increase in the Chairman fees for the Remuneration Committee to $27,000 from $16,425\n\n\u00a7 Increase in the Chairman fees for the Zero Harm Committee to $27,000 from $16,425\n\n\u00a7 Increase in the Chairman fees for the Tender Risk Evaluation Committee to $17,000 from $16,425\n\n\u00a7 Introduction of fees for committee members at the rate of 50% of the respective committee Chairman fee.\n\n51"

The Mining business unit (previously a separate reportable segment) and the Engineering and Construction business unit (previously reported as part of the EC&M segment), have been included within All other segments following the reduction in their contribution to the Group\u2019s performance following divestments and wind-down of contracts. The new structure aligns the segment reporting with Downer\u2019s end markets and management reporting structure.\n\nThe reportable segments are based on a combination of operating segments determined by the similarity of the services provided, the sources of the Group\u2019s major risks that could therefore have the greatest effect on the rates of return and their quantitative contribution to the Group\u2019s results.\n\nThe Group has restated the previously reported segment information for the year ended 30 June 2021.\n\n68\n\nB1.

A tax benefit of $6.2 million has also been recognised in respect of previously unbooked capital losses used to offset capital gains arising on the Mining divestments.\n\nThe IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) issued an agenda decision in April 2021 which impacts whether a customer can recognise an intangible asset in relation to configuration or customisation of cloud computing arrangements (CCA), specifically for Software-as-a-Service (SaaS).

The Company defines counterparties as \u2018Government\u2019 if the contract is with a Federal, State or Local Government body. Any counterparties other than those defined as \u2018Government\u2019 are classified as \u2018Private\u2019, and includes sectors heavily regulated by Government organisations (such as Gas and Electricity), Blue-Chip listed companies, contracts run under the Public-Private-Partnership model ((PPPs) for which Government organisations are often the end customer), large multinational companies, network infrastructure companies, as well as other private sector businesses.\n\nThe credit risk associated with Government balances is considered to be negligible (2021: negligible) due to the high creditworthiness of the counterparties.

The key disaggregation of the balances is between those that are backed by Government funding and those that are not and between those that are current or are overdue less than 90 days or become more than 90 days overdue. The Group exercises considerable judgement about how economic factors (such as the economic impact triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic) affect the ECL of each of the disaggregated balances independently, and applies a premium as deemed appropriate to adjust the historically determined default rates to present the total expected credit losses on the current balances.\n\nThis impairment model applies to financial assets measured at amortised cost or FVOCI (except for investments in equity instruments)."

Contract liabilities are recognised as revenue when work is performed under the contract.\n\nIf the net amount of the Company\u2019s rights to consideration for work performed after deduction of progress payments received is negative, the difference is recognised as a liability and included as part of Contract liabilities.\n\nOf the Contract liabilities balance of $444.3 million at 30 June 2021, substantially all of this revenue has been recognised in the current year.\n\nFair value\n\nDue to the short-term nature of these financial obligations, their carrying amounts are estimated to represent their fair values."

The scheme is closed to new employees.\n\nAs at 30 June 2022, the fair value of plan assets (comprising Investment Funds) was $58.6 million. The plan obligation balance was $53.2 million. The net asset of $5.4 million is included in Non-current prepayments and other assets. These balances were subject to an independent actuarial review as at 30 June 2022.\n\nThe main movements during the year were $1.6 million of services costs expensed to the profit or loss, $6.8 million of actuarial gains on the obligation, and the Group contributions of $1.1 million (all pre-tax amounts).\n\nKey actuarial assumptions used in determining the values were a discount rate of 4.4% and an expected salary increase rate of 3.0%. Sensitivity analysis shows a 0.5 percentage point reduction in the discount rate would increase the obligation by 4.2% and 0.5 percentage point increase in the expected salary increase rate would increase the obligation by 3.6%."

These businesses have demonstrated strength and resilience, hold market-leading positions and attractive medium-term and long-term growth opportunities.

In FY21, Downer revisited its materiality assessment in line with the GRI Standards via a rigorous independently-led process to formally engage internal and external stakeholders to understand what they believe are the material sustainability issues for Downer and inform the identification of its material issues by economic, social, environmental and governance.\n\nThe materiality assessment provided key sustainability insights for Downer\u2019s strategy and frames the content for this year\u2019s Sustainability Report.

Downer is committed to reducing its direct emissions profile and is well positioned to service our customers through the energy transition essential for the broader economy to achieve Net Zero by 2050.\n\nIn FY22, an assessment was commenced to quantify the estimated financial impact of different climate scenarios on Downer\u2019s value chain. It also assessed the potential mitigation costs against the identified risks. There are three key areas of focus for this work: Downer\u2019s fleet, our asphalt plants, and the physical climate impacts on Downer\u2019s fixed assets and key operational locations.\n\nA review was also commenced to review Downer\u2019s current capital asset decision-making process.
