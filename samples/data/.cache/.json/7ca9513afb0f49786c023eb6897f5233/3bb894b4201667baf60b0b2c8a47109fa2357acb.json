The intention of this program is to facilitate goal congruence between directors/executives with that of the business and shareholders. Where applicable, the KPI\u2019s are set annually, with a certain level of consultation with directors/executives to ensure buy-in. The measures are specifically tailored to the areas each director/executive is involved in and has a level of control over. The KPI\u2019s target areas the Board believes hold greater potential for the consolidated entity expansion and profit, covering financial and non-financial as well as short-term and long- term goals. The level set for each KPI is based on budgeted figures for the consolidated entity and respective industry standards.\n\ny\n\nl\n\nn\n\no\n\nPerformance in relation to the KPI\u2019s is assessed annually, with bonuses being awarded depending on the number and deemed difficulty of the KPI\u2019s achieved.
