Our sustainability initiatives and values give the business a purpose and help us on our way to becoming the industry's sustainability leader.\n\nAs we entered 2022, everyone wanted to leave the pandemic behind. But it continued to affect our customer base in the HoReCa sector. When the restrictions were then eased in the spring, the industry saw a strong upswing. People wanted to meet, eat and travel again. Festivals, par- ties and weddings could finally take place. The third quarter, which was the first full quarter that was not affected by any restrictions, saw a sales increase of 26.2%, and we delivered an operating income figure that was historically strong.\n\nThe Duni business area grew by 50.4% during the year, and had a 43.9% increase in sales at fixed exchange rates during the year compared with 2021. This is partly due to eased restrictions, partly to price increases. The BioPak business area increased by 23.9% compared with 2021, as a result of price increases and some growth. Together, this had a direct impact on the Group's operating income, which amounted to SEK 450 million (279).\n\nGroup sales for the year totaled SEK 6,976 million (5,061) in 2022, which cor- responds to a sales increase of 37.8%. Adjusted for exchange rate fluctuations, net sales increased by 30.9%."

The consequences of the geopolitical situation remain uncertain, for example how the purchasing behavior of end consumers will be affected.\n\nEnergy is the biggest concern, both price and supply. We implemented several price\n\nincreases in 2022 to compensate for increased costs. Our paper mill in Skapa- fors switched to BioLPG in 2021, but now the supply is threatened by the war in Ukraine.\n\nLooking on the bright side, restaurants are open. During the pandemic, our market practically disappeared, but we coped relatively well anyway. The key going forward as an organization is to be adaptable. We are prioritizing precisely this and training our managers to lead in times of uncertainty and change."

That's why we want to support restaurants and those who work in the industry, while at the same time it's good for us,\" says Johan, continuing:\n\n\u201cWe have the brand, the network and the reach, and strongly rooted trust. But we need more of a technological edge and new kinds of services. New ways of working will be needed, and this plat- form is a good example.\"\n\nJohan is encountering a growing realiza- tion that innovation is crucial to achieving the company\u2019s goals for 2030. More and more people see an innovation culture as being necessary, as well as continu- ously developing their skills.\n\nCommunication and new processes\n\nCommunication and new processes Investments in startups in 2022 and the establishment of new internal work meth- ods have produced results. These cross- fertilizations have taught the Group to be more agile. For example, a more agile way of working has been introduced, with \u201cNew Business Demo\" in particular being appreciated within the organization.\n\n\u201cEvery month the innovation department presents exactly where we are, our prob- lems, what went well and if we need help. This results in an increased sharing of knowledge internally, and we learn and adapt continuously during our process,\u201d says Johan."

These issues are best solved through various collaborations on new business models and the reuse of products.\n\nThe value chain for single-use items will continue to be heavily impacted by the EU, as well as by changes in national leg- islation.

In addition, legislation (especially in the EU) is increasingly focused on topics such as littering, extended producer responsibility and recyclability. This category is part of our strate- gy's sustainability initiative \"Becoming Circular at Scale\", as waste management solutions such as recy- cling and reuse can help close the material flow\u2019s cycle. It is therefore absolutely crucial that we address the problems and challenges of preventing and collecting waste. This will make it easier for us to comply with the proposed Packaging and Pack- aging Waste Regulation (PPWR) from the EU."

This is why we are developing multi-use solutions while continuing to improve the sustainability per- formance of our products and packaging. The phase- out of virgin fossil plastic is part of our \"Becoming Circular at Scale\u201d initiative, and the goal is a 50% reduction between 2019 and 2025. In 2022, we had reduced this by 25%."

Even in the design phase, we must ensure that products and packaging can be recycled or reused.\n\nThere is considerable uncertainty in this area.

Duni Group made several important improvements in 2022.\n\nOne important goal for the Group is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This includes both our own operations (GHG Protocol Scopes 1 and 2) and, in the long term, our entire value chain (Scope 3). In 2022, we carried out several activities that bring us closer to our goal of net zero carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 for Scopes 1 and 2.\n\nIt is important for us to be transparent and to communicate our results. So in 2022, we began reporting carbon diox- ide emissions (Scopes 1 and 2) in our quarterly reports. Once more, we were the first in our industry."

Based on our sustainability strategy, we set a goal to achieve a carbon intensity index of 40 by 2025, using 2019 as the base year. During our quarterly reporting this year, we have seen signifi- cant reductions in our Scope 2 emissions, mainly due to the switch to renewable electricity in all our European factories.\n\nWe can now see that we have reached index 37 for 2022, largely thanks to the significantly increased production volumes from the market's recovery after the pan- demic. The next step is to switch from LPG to renewable fuels in our paper mill in Sweden, as this is the largest remaining source of emissions in our operations. Reporting includes CO,, CH, and N,O."

Scope 3 includes all of Duni\u2019s indirect upstream and downstream emis- sions in the value chain. There are 15 data categories in Scope 3, twelve of which are material to us and are therefore included in the compilation. The three excluded are upstream and downstream leased assets (included in Scopes 1 and 2) and franchise operations (not relevant). The base year for the calculation is 2019, which was the last full year without any impact from the pandemic. In most cases, primary data is used, although it is supplemented with assumptions where data is not avail- able. For purchased services in category 1, spend-based data is used. Translation into CO,e was done by applying emission fac- tors provided by an external partner.\n\nScope 3 emissions data will give us new insights into how our purchases and our organizational activities affect our overall climate impact. This will enable us to make fact-based decisions in the future to reduce emissions from our operations,\n\nsuppliers and product portfolio. During the initial process of mapping and linking to our business, five key categories were identified that are expected to have the greatest impact on our emissions. These are: purchased goods and services, up- stream and downstream transportation and distribution, waste generation and end-of-life treatment of sold products."

The activities to be considered as sustainable are defined by technical screening criteria, which are defined in delegated acts to the Regulation.\n\nAn economic activity that is are neither taxon- omy-eligible nor taxonomy-aligned refers to any activity that is not described in the dele- gated acts of the Taxonomy Regulation.\n\nNet sales\n\nDuni Group has reviewed the Group's revenue- generating activities for 2022 to see which of these are taxonomy-eligible and taconomy- aligned respectively. The Group's revenue- generating activities are categorized into the wholesale and retail industry, which is a sector that is not covered by the regulation in 2022. 100% of the Group's net sales are thereby deemed non-eligible."

The first two are directly related to current or planned revenue-generating oper- ations, which are or will become eligible, and are therefore not relevant for Duni Group. The third category concerns expenditure to suppliers whose activities are subject to the taxonomy or expenditure related to individual measures aimed at improving energy effi- ciency, if these are included in the taxonomy. Duni Group has reviewed its investments and operational expenditure to see if they can be classified as eligible or covered by the taxonomy. We identified five eligible activities related to investments that contribute to climate change mitigation, in accordance with Annex | of the first delegated act.\n\n6.5. Transportation by motorbikes, passenger cars and light commercial vehicles This economic activity includes the purchasing, financing, renting, leasing and operation of vehicles classified as category M1, N1, both falling under the scope of Regulation (EC)\n\n63\n\nSustainability Report 2022 / Sustainability and social responsibility\n\nNo 715/2007 of the European Parliament and of the Council. Duni Group leases vehicles primarily in its sales operations, and these include both vehicles with internal combustion engines and hybrid and electric vehicles. New leases are signed for electric or hybrid vehicles whenever possible."

The strategy is based on the UN's Agenda 2030 with its seventeen global sustainability goals and, together with a long-term vision and a higher purpose, will strengthen the Group in the market. The strategy has a strong focus on sustainable and circular solutions, where the Group strives to lead and accelerate development. Five core areas - Position, Inno- vation, Customers, Operations and People & Culture - cover how the Group will develop its offer and produce, but also how it will act towards employees and customers as well as other stakeholders in the value chain and the surrounding society.\n\nThe three main macro trends affecting the business are sustain- ability and circular models, hygiene and digitization. On the environ- mental side, developments are driven by a general growing aware- ness of the importance of making choices that slow down climate change. In addition to growing public opinion, new laws and regula- tions are a key driver, such as the EU Plastics Directive. The demand for hygiene solutions created by the pandemic continues to be strong. The pandemic also accelerated the adoption of digital solutions, which now have a strong foothold throughout the value chain, from design to consumer and end-of-life solutions."

This stimulates consumption within HoReCa and also the demand for the Group's products and services. The long-term trend contin- ues to point towards an increasing number of restaurant visits, driven mainly by increasing urbanization, changed consumption pat- terns and a lifestyle trend whereby meals are increasingly consumed on the go. New restaurant concepts, such as prepared food in gro- cery stores, take-away and quick service restaurants, continue to grow and take an increasing market share, even after the pandemic. The recovery in the HoReCa market is satisfactory. It is evident that restaurant visits are being prioritized once more when this is possible. The ongoing energy crisis in Europe, as a consequence of the war in Ukraine, has resulted in sharply rising inflation, which has forced the industry to compensate with price increases, which will continue. Con- sumers in mature European markets are now showing greater inter- est in seeking value, and HoReCa companies are competing harder to reach a larger share of the total mealtime market. On the customer side, continued structural changes are taking place within the restau- rant industry, with restaurant chains that operate under joint brands growing at a faster rate than the market in general. This is a develop- ment that benefits the Group's sales of customized concepts."

Here, there is clear potential for the Duni Group to create growth.\n\nFuture Outlook\n\nThe HoReCa sector is heavily influenced by changes in people's life- styles. The hotel and restaurant industry in Europe is an important customer segment for the Group. The recovery in the market, follow- ing the pandemic, will continue to be volatile, but stable over time.\n\nIn general, long-term demand is driven primarily by improved purchasing power combined with changing habits, including an increased share of meals outside the home. Demand for brand-pro- filed, environmentally sound single-use products is also increasing. Furthermore, the trend towards increased accessibility and conve- nience connected with meals is continuing, and thus the take-away alternative is continuing to grow. This trend is reinforced by the increase in the number of single households and the fact that urbanization is continuing.\n\nSignificant events after the balance sheet date\n\nNo significant events have occurred since the balance sheet date."

These risks affect, among other things, the company's business model and long-term strategic planning. They may have a negative impact on the Group's results or reputation.\n\nStrategic and environmental risks refer to risks and external factors that have an impact on the company\u2019s business and market position. The Board and management develop strategies to manage these risks, which is done through strategy meetings. This includes risks related to acquisitions, suppliers, regulations and laws. External fac- tors that may also affect operations include raw material prices, trans- port costs, local restrictions due to a pandemic, a worsening econ- omy, and changes in market demand and taxes. Events that could lead to fewer restaurant visits, reduced demand and increased price competition, affect volumes and gross margins, among other things through increased discounts and customer bonuses. The develop- ment of a varied and attractive range is important for the Group to achieve good sales and earnings development.\n\nOperational risks are normally handled by the respective operat- ing unit and may refer to production interruptions, IT breakdowns, fire or other risks due to insufficient processes or handling errors. In many cases, the company can control this type of risk itself."

The social restrictions introduced to prevent the spread of infection resulted in government agencies restricting people's mobility. The Duni business area sells its products primarily in the HoReCa sector. Hotel, restaurant and catering businesses were all significantly affected by these restrictions. They were forced to operate under severe restrictions, if they were allowed to open at all. Throughout the pandemic, there was a volatile market and the level of restrictions varied between the quarters. There was a clear correlation between sales and the level of restrictions. The Duni business area is vertically integrated, and owns its own paper mill and conversion plants that produce napkins and table covers. A rapid, unscheduled decrease in volume means that fixed costs are not fully absorbed, with a negative impact on income. The BioPak business area offers environmentally sound concepts for meal pack- aging and serving products for applications including take-away. The business area does not have in-house production, instead purchas- ing its products primarily from China and Europe. Many restaurants had to convert their operations during the pandemic so they could offer more take-away than before, which had a positive impact on the BioPak business area.

The Board believes that the Duni Group has recovered well after the pandemic. The divestment of 25% of the shares in BioPak Pty Ltd further strengthens the balance sheet. Despite better conditions, there is uncertainty in the world at large and continued volatility in demand. The assessment is that the Group has a sound financial position and future competitiveness that allows a dividend equivalent to SEK 141 million, which is equiv- alent to 70% of income after tax. The Board believes that even after the proposed dividend, Duni will still be able to meet its obligations and complete planned investments."

What is discussed at each meeting is reported by the Committee's chair at the next Board meeting, which is usually held later on the same day."

The Board receives a monthly written report covering sales, operating income, the mar- ket trend, as well as other material information regarding the opera- tions, and a review of current financial reports constitutes a stand- ing item on the agenda at all meetings. Group Management analy- ses the financial trend within the Group's business areas each month. Comparisons with the preceding year, budgets and plans, and evaluation of the key performance indicators are used for moni- toring generally at all levels in the organization.\n\nStatement regarding internal audit\n\nIn addition, Group Management has formulated its view on how business is to be conducted in a Code of Conduct, which is reviewed each year by the Board of Directors. There is an independent whistleblowing system to which any employee or other external party can write about experienced or observed misconduct by senior executives. Anonymity is voluntary and the recipients of the infor- mation are a designated whistleblowing committee consisting of the Chair of the Audit Committee, the CFO and the EVP People & Culture."

        "page_content": "The administration has found no need for a formal internal audit department, but it annually evaluates whether such a function is needed. The Group has an accounting center in Poznan, Poland, which functions as a centralized accounting function providing accounting services to all subsidiaries in Europe, apart from Paper+Design in Germany and BioPak UK Ltd. The accounting cen- ter along with the accounts department at the head office serve as consultants to the countries within the Group that are not included in the center. The accounting center operates based on standard- ized processes and routines, is independent of the operational busi- ness, and reports directly to the CFO. They also perform engage- ments for external customers, similar to the engagements they per- form for the Group. This centralized and independent process for accounting and financial reporting is considered to constitute a plat- form for sound internal control with respect to financial reporting. The Group's financial department also performs certain internal audit work in the form of controls at subsidiaries.\n\nThe organizational structure together with the division of responsibilities and payment authorization procedure are clearly described and communicated by means of instructions and policies.\n\n80\n\n/ Board of Directors"

An investor has a controlling interest over the investee when the investor is exposed to, or is entitled to variable returns from, the investment in the investee and can influence the amount of the returns using its controlling interest over the investee. Subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements commencing on the day on which the controlling influ- ence is transferred to the Group. They are removed from the con- solidated financial statements as of the day on which the controlling influence ceases.\n\nThe acquisition method is used for reporting the Group's busi- ness combinations. The consideration for the acquisition of a sub- sidiary consists of the fair value of transferred assets, liabilities and the shares issued by the Group. The consideration also includes the fair value of all assets or liabilities which are a consequence of an agreement regarding a conditional purchase price and/or liability to minority shareholders. Acquisition-related costs are expensed when incurred. Identifiable acquired assets and assumed liabilities in a business acquisition are initially measured at fair value on the acqui- sition date. For each acquisition, it is determined whether non-con- trolling interests in the acquired company are recognized at fair value or at the interest's proportional share in the net assets of the acquired company."

Upon acquisitions from non-controlling interests, the difference between the consideration paid and the actual acquired share of the carrying amount of the subsidiary\u2019s net assets is recog- nized in equity. Gains or losses upon divestments to non-controlling interests are also recognized in equity. Non-controlling interests in an acquired company are recognized either at fair value or at the holding's proportionate share of the identifiable net assets of the acquired company. This choice of principle is made for each individ- ual business acquisition.\n\nIn cases where there are call options for remaining sharehold- ings, the companies are recognized as if they were fully consoli- dated and a liability is simultaneously recognized amounting to the discounted expected redemption price of the options. The non-con- trolling interest attributable to the option is thus eliminated. The dif- ference between the liability for the option and the non-controlling interest to which the option related is recognized directly in equity and separated from other changes in equity. The liability to minority shareholders is recognized as a derivative instrument, and the reval- uation is recognized in equity."

The decision-making group constitutes Group Management, which decides on the allocation of resources within the Group and evaluates the results of operations. The strategic decision-making group addresses and evaluates opera- tions based on lines of business, or operating segments, to which the same risks and opportunities apply. Sales between the business areas take place on market terms.\n\nDuni business area: stands for what the Group is traditionally associ- ated with - innovative solutions for the set table, primarily napkins, table covers and candles. The business area's products and services are sold under the Duni brand. Its customers are primarily hotels and restau- rants, the HoReCa market, with sales largely made via wholesalers, but grocery retail chains are also a key customer group, along with other chan- nels such as various types of specialty stores."

Corresponding allocations have also been made when allocating Group-wide expenses.\n\nWith the implementation of IFRS, allocation of the Group's goodwill items has taken place through allocation ratios. In addition, goodwill on acquisition has been allocated to the cash-generating units and operating segments based on a judgment of which units will benefit from the synergies, etc. created by the business combination. Part of the goodwill comprises SEK 1,199 million for the old organization before the Duni Group was listed, and this is allocated to the Duni segment. The remaining goodwill is goodwill on acquisition that arose when var- ious companies were acquired. These companies have been allocated to a segment based on what products they sell. The companies that manufacture napkins have been allocated to the Duni segment. More detailed disclosures on the allocation of goodwill can be found in Note 21 - Intangible assets.\n\nHowever, interest income and interest expenses are not allocated per segment since they are affected by measures taken by the central treasury function, which manages the Group's cash liquidity."

Revenue is recognized only to the extent it is highly probable that no substantial reversal will occur. A liability is recognized for expected volume discounts in relation to sales until the balance sheet date. Given that the magnitude of returns has been stable in the past years, it is highly probable that there will not be any substantial reversal of recognized revenue. The validity of customer agreements, entitlement to discounts, customer bonuses and returns, and the esti- mated quantity of returns or customer bonuses is reassessed at each balance sheet date. No financial component is deemed to be estab- lished since the sale takes place with an average credit period of 45 days, which is in accordance with market practice. Returned goods are recognized as their gross amounts in the balance sheet. Estimated returned goods are recognized as a provision and the cost of sold goods with respect to the recognized returned goods increases inventories."

As a result of the difficult situation, all deliveries to the sales company in Russia were halted, and in the first quarter of 2022 a decision was made to divest the business (with 17 employees), which took place through a management buy- out in April. This resulted in a restructuring cost of SEK 9 million for the Group and SEK 15 million for the Parent Company. This relates primarily to write-downs of inventories and accounts receivable. The Parent Company added a write-down of an internal receivable.\n\n25% of the shares in Australia-based company BioPak Pty Ltd were divested in December 2022. One-off expenses were incurred on an ongoing basis during the year as a restructuring cost in respect of the costs of evaluating strategic alternatives to optimize the long-term value of the BioPak Group. 25% of the shares were divested to Five V Capital, a private equity company based in Australia. In total, including legal costs for contracts in connection with the divestment, the restructuring cost amounted to SEK 48 million for the Group and SEK 4 million for the Parent Company."

The bonus system covers only one year each time following a decision by the Board of Direc- tors. A bonus of SEK 2.9 million (0) was paid to the CEO for the fiscal year 2022. In February 2021, the Remuneration Committee decided that no performance-based bonus would be paid for the fiscal year 2021, as the Group continued to be affected by the pandemic and many of the Group's companies have received government grants. No performance criteria for variable remuneration were therefore drawn up for 2021. The performance criteria for variable remunera- tion for the fiscal year 2022 consist of a financial performance mea- sure applicable to both the CEO and other senior executives. The performance measure is Residual Income and consists of operating income minus 8% interest on managed capital. For more details, see the Remuneration Report 2022 on the Company's website.

The pension plans are normally financed through payments to insurance companies or managed funds, where the payments are determined based on periodic actuarial calculations. The Duni Group has both defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans. A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which fixed contributions are paid to a separate legal entity. The Group has no legal or informal obligations to pay additional contri- butions if the legal entity has insufficient assets to pay all compensa- tion to employees relating to the employee's service during a current or earlier period. The majority of the Group's pension remuneration is paid via defined contribution plans. A defined benefit plan is a pension plan which is not a defined contribution plan. The distinguishing fea- ture of defined benefit plans is that they state an amount for the pen- sion benefit an employee will receive after retirement, normally based on one or more factors such as age, period of employment and salary."

Assumptions regarding the discount rate are based on high-quality investments at fixed interest with a term to maturity corresponding to the Group's existing pension obligations. Other demographic conditions are based on established industry practice.\n\nThe largest pension plan (approximately one half of pension obliga- tions) is in Sweden, where there is no sufficiently liquid market for cor- porate bonds. Accordingly, the discount rate for the Swedish pension liability is based on mortgage bonds with a term to maturity corre- sponding to the pension plan. The Group believes that it is possible to equate Swedish mortgage bonds with investment-grade corporate bonds since the market for such bonds has a high turnover and is con- sidered to be liquid and deep; furthermore, these bonds often have a triple A rating and thus are extremely creditworthy."

For the fiscal year 2022, the Company did not have access to informa- tion needed to recognize its proportional share of the plan's obliga- tions, plan assets and expenses. As a result, it was not possible to recognize the plan as a defined benefit plan. Duni does not have\n\naccess to such information as makes it possible to recognize this plan as a defined benefit plan. The pension plan according to ITP 2, which is secured through insurance with Alecta, is thus recognized as a defined contribution plan. The premium for the defined benefit retirement and family pension is calculated on an individual basis and depends, among other things, on salary, previously earned pen- sion entitlement, and expected remaining period of employment. Expected contributions for the next reporting period for ITP 2 poli- cies taken out with Alecta amounted to SEK 2 million (4)."

Most of the plan assets are either unaffected by inflation (fixed interest on bonds) or have a weak correlation to inflation (equities), entailing that an increase in inflation will also increase the deficit.\n\n+ Asset volatility: The plan's liabilities are calculated using a dis- count rate which is based on corporate bonds. In line with pre- vious years, the discount rate is set for the Swedish plans by reference to the market for covered mortgage bonds.

New shareholder agreements were signed in the new ownership structure in connection with the divestment. The liability relating to the minority owner's option that was recognized as a derivative instrument was SEK 380 million at the time of divestment, and was dissolved with asettlement amount of SEK 66 million, which was paid in December. The entire transaction is deemed to constitute a transaction with the minority owners and is therefore recognized directly in equity at a total of SEK 743 million (SEK 429 million + SEK 380 million - SEK 66 million). The Duni Group continues to have a majority shareholding of 55% in BioPak Pty and controls the company, and it will therefore continue to be consolidated 100% in the Group. As a result of the sale, 45% of the BioPak Group's profit after tax will be recognized as Non-controlling interests, and earnings per share attributable to the Parent Company's shareholders will be affected.

Each business area has full responsibility for its respec- tive value chain. These business areas make up the operating seg- ments. Each business area is responsible for its respective branding strategy, marketing communications, product development and innovation. The Duni business area has a vertically integrated busi- ness model for small paper-based products such as napkins and table covers. The BioPak business area does not have any in-house manufacturing or production. Group-wide functions such as accounting, HR, communications, sustainability, and IT are largely shared by the business areas, and the expenses for these are allo- cated by the percentage of sales of each business area. The busi- ness areas are the two cash-generating units. Goodwill has been allocated to these based on the product portfolio of the respective acquisitions and thus the business area to which they belong. In 2022, measures were taken so that Sharp Serviettes can be consid- ered to be integrated into the Duni business area. This concerns both the business plan and reporting paths, as well as follow-up by the company. There is therefore no longer any impairment testing of individual companies.\n\nImpairment testing for goodwill is performed annually at the end of the fiscal year and when there are indications of impairment."

The leases may include both lease and non-lease components. The Group allocates the remuneration of the contract to lease and non-lease components based on their relative independent prices. However, for lease payments relating to properties for which the Group is a tenant, the Group has opted not to separate lease and non-lease components, instead recognizing these as a single lease component. The terms and conditions are negotiated separately for each contract and have many different provisions. The leases do not contain any special conditions or restrictions expect that the lessor retains the rights to pledged leased assets.

The reserving method is selected based on\n\nAccounts receivable are written off and recognized as incurred losses when information has been obtained that the customer will likely be unable to pay an invoice for reasons such as bankruptcy or unsuccess- ful garnishment attempts."

The Duni Group's previ- ous hedging arrangements qualified for hedge accounting under IFRS 9 and the hedging documentation has therefore been updated in accor- dance with this.\n\nThe effective part of changes in fair value on a derivative instrument which is identified as a cash flow hedge and which satisfies the condi- tions for hedge accounting is recognized in Other comprehensive income.

The Group enters into interest rate swaps that have the same critical terms as the hedged object. Critical terms can be the reference rate, interest conversion dates, payment dates, due dates and the nominal amount. The Group does not hedge 100% of its loans and therefore only identifies the share of outstanding loans corresponding to the nominal amounts of the swaps. Ineffectiveness could arise because of CVA/DVA adjustment to the interest rate swap. There was no significant ineffectiveness attributable to interest rate swaps in 2022 and 2021"

The fair value of derivatives traded on an active market is based on the listed market prices on the balance sheet date, which means the current purchase price. For financial instru- ments which are not traded on an active market (e.g. OTC derivatives), the fair value is determined through the use of various valuation tech- niques. The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the value of future cash flows discounted using current market interest rates, while the fair value of currency forward contracts is established through the use of listed prices for currency forward contracts on the balance sheet date. Recognition of subsequent changes in value depends on whether the derivative has been identified as a hedging instrument and, if such is the case, the nature of the hedged item. If a hedging arrangement has not been identified, the change in value of the derivative instrument is recognized in the income statement. Call and put options entered into with minority shareholders upon business combination are recognized directly in equity as a transaction with minority shareholders. The Duni Group uses derivative instruments as hedging instruments for forecast cash flows or hedges of net investments in foreign operations."

The gain or loss attributable to the ineffective part is recognized imme- diately in the income statement as other revenue or other expenses. Accumulated gains and losses in equity are classified to profit or loss when foreign operations are fully or partially divested.\n\nClassification and recognition\n\nInformation regarding the fair value for various derivative instruments used for hedging purposes is provided in this note. Changes in the hedging reserve in equity are set forth in the consolidated statement of changes in equity. The entire fair value of a derivative which constitutes a hedge instrument is classified as a fixed asset or long-term liability when the outstanding term of the hedged item exceeds 12 months, and as a current asset or short-term liability when the outstanding term of the hedged item is less than 12 months. Derivative instru- ments held for trading are always classified as current assets or short- term liabilities."

The listed market price used for the Group's financial assets is the current bid price. For financial instruments which are not traded on an active mar- ket, the fair value is determined through the use of various valuation techniques. The Group uses a number of different methods and makes assumptions based on the market conditions prevailing on the balance sheet date. Listed market prices or broker listings for similar instru- ments are used with respect to long-term liabilities. Other techniques, such as calculation of discounted cash flows, are used to establish the fair value of the remaining financial instruments.\n\nThe carrying amount of accounts receivable and accounts payable, less any impairment, is assumed to correspond to fair value since these items are short-term in nature. For information purposes, the fair value of financial liabilities is calculated by discounting the future con- tracted cash flows to the current market interest rate which is available to the Group for similar financial instruments. For other financial assets and liabilities, the fair value is deemed to be in line with the carrying amount, due to the short expected maturity.\n\nPursuant to the standard for financial instruments, disclosure is required regarding measurement to fair value per level in the following fair value hierarchy:"

Purchases by subsidiaries, primarily internal, may however be made in currencies other than the subsidiary\u2019's own functional cur- rency, and thus these purchases are exposed to a currency risk. By also directing the internal flows as far as possible to the functional currency of the recipient subsidiary, the currency risk is concen- trated to a small number of subsidiaries. The Group's external out- flows are primarily in SEK, USD and PLN, while external inflows are primarily in AUD, DKK, NOK, CHF and GBP. The Group's policy is to not hedge flows in foreign currency in any way other than as is described above. There is also no policy to hedge interest pay- ments, either internal or external.\n\nThrough the subsidiary Rexcell Tissue & Airlaid AB there is indi- rect currency risk in USD. Internationally, pulp is priced in USD, and thus a strengthening/weakening of the USD gives rise to increased or reduced purchasing costs for the Group."

Reval- uation of these items to the exchange rate at the balance sheet date is included in the Group's income.\n\nThe financial borrowing and lending in the individual subsidiaries is primarily internal through the Parent Company and in the respec- tive subsidiary's functional currency.

The Parent Company's internal lending and borrow- ing also takes place at variable rates. Part of the interest rate risk has been hedged at a fixed rate through interest rate swaps, maturing between December 2022 and December 2027.

As described, among other things, in the management report and in note 34, Duni is affected by the volatile prices of input materials and trade goods that characterized 2022, above all shipping and energy prices. The uncertainty in the supply chains has also meant that Duni has increased its safety stocks. Duni's inventory consists of both self-produced products and purchased products. The complexity in the valuation of stock mainly concerns the in-house manufactured products. When determining product calculations, there are a number of trade-offs that need to be made by the company management that have an impact on the reported values, among other things, regarding exchange rates, raw material prices and allocation keys for other direct and indirect costs. Duni has an established process to ensure that the inventory is correctly valued according to FIFO in the external reporting. For finished goods, an assessment needs to be made of whether the products have been exposed to obsolescence and how salable they are.\n\nKey audit matter"

The Board believes that the Duni Group has recovered well after the pandemic. The divestment of 25% of the shares in BioPak Pty Ltd further strengthens the balance sheet. Despite better condi- tions, there is uncertainty in the world at large and continued volatility in demand. The assessment is that the Group has a sound financial position and future competi- tiveness that allows a dividend equivalent to SEK 141 million, which is equivalent to 70% of income after tax. The Board believes that even after the proposed dividend, the Group will still be able to meet its obliga- tions and complete planned investments.\n\nThe Nomination Committee has the task of submitting proposals to the AGM regarding the election of the Board, auditors and alternate auditors, and their fees. Complete information regarding the AGM is available on the website.\n\nTimetable for financial information: Publication dates: April 21, 2023 - January-March 2023 Interim Report,\n\nJuly 14, 2023\n\n- January-June 2023 Interim Report,\n\nOctober 24, 2023 - January-September 2023 Interim Report."
